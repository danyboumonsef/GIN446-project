            <h2>Origins of the Web</h2>
            <p>In 1989, a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at CERN. Its purpose was to distribute scientific research easily between universities and institutes. His first proposal suggested a system called “Information Management: A Proposal”, but it lacked detailed specifications, so he submitted a second proposal called “Hypertext and CERN”, outlining the concepts of URLs, HTML, and a protocol for requesting and transferring documents. This laid the foundation for the modern web. </p>

            <h2>Web Evolution</h2>
            <p>After the world wide web, Line-mode browser, the second web browser ever was created. It was text-based and could run on various computers. Shortly after, Mosaic became the first graphical browser. It allowed users to view images and navigate hyperlinks. Its success inspired Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer leading to the browser wars. The competition accelerated innovation, leading to the creation of CSS, JavaScript and many more. HTML progressed through versions 2.0, 3.2, 4.01, XHTML and HTML5, allowing web pages to work consistently across browsers</p>

                <h3>History of CSS</h3>
                <P>CSS was created by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. It is a fundamental language in web development used to style and make web content lively by allowing users to choose layout, fonts and colors. It started with CSS1, which introduced basic features for text styling, font properties, margins, padding, color and background styling and the box model. Then it was followed by CSS2, which added more sophisticated selectors and properties to enhance styling options. Later, CSS2.1 came in to solve all the inconsistencies in CSS2. Finally, CSS3 took over, enabling more advanced styling, animations, and responsive designs that are essential for modern websites. <a href="references.html">[3]</a></P>

            <h2>The Future of the Web</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, the web is evolving with cloud-based applications, AI integration and voice browsing which expand the ways users interact with online content. The next major phase is Web 4.0, also called the Intelligent or Symbiotic Web. It is based on machine learning, AI, and decentralized technology. Some of its key features are artificial intelligence, Internet of things, Decentralization, Advanced Interactivity and User-Centric Design. It is expected to impact industries such as Healthcare, smart city management, Agriculture, Education and Transportation. <a href="references.html">[5]</a></p>
