    <h1>Security of the Web</h1>

      <h2>Brief History</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of internet security began in the early 1970s. Bob Thomas, a programmer at BBN, created a program called <strong>"Creeper"</strong> which spread between computers. It wasn't harmful but it showed that programs could spread across machines without permission, and that networks were vulnerable to attacks. Shortly after, another programmer named Ray Tomlinson created a program called <strong>"Reaper"</strong> to remove Creeper. This is considered as the first antivirus. Later on, as the internet grew with the creations of emails, websites, and banking systems, real hacking attempts appeared. This resulted in the necessity of stronger security measures and improvements in encryption, firewalls, and many more security methods.

  <h2>Common Risks:</h2>
  <p>There are many risks and threats on the web that affect users daily. Here are some:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Viruses</h3>
      <p>
        Software designed to cause damage to computers, spying, or deleting and taking control of data.  
        Symptoms include slow system speed, unwanted pop-up windows, programs self-executing, accounts being logged out suddenly, device crashes, and mass emails being sent from your account.

      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Data Breach</h3>
      <p>
        A data breach occurs when a threat actor gains unauthorized access to protected data, usually as part of a cybersecurity attack. They may steal, disclose, or extort the data owner.  
        Example attacks include Facebook (2021), Avast (2019), and China Data Leak (May 2025). <sup><a href="references.html#r8">[8]</a></sup>    
</a>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Phishing</h3>
      <p>
        Faking a trusted identity (like a reputable company) to trick users into revealing sensitive info such as credit cards and passwords.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Unsecured Websites</h3>
      <p>
        Websites using HTTP instead of HTTPS can be breached, allowing private info like passwords to be intercepted. Using simple or repeated passwords can also give hackers access to multiple accounts.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Deceiving or Malicious Pop-up Ads</h3>
      <p>
        Tricks users into clicking and installing viruses on their devices.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Careless Downloads</h3>
      <p>
        Downloading files from untrusted sources may contain malware.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Cyberbullying</h3>
      <p>
        Bullying and abuse on social media, especially affecting young users. Examples include spreading lies, posting embarrassing photos/videos, sending abusive or threatening messages, impersonating someone, and sexual harassment or bullying using generative AI tools. <sup><a href="references.html#r9">[9]</a></sup>

  <h2>Safe Practices for Internet Security:</h2>
  <p>
    Avoiding online risks can't be guaranteed, but there are many solutions in cybersecurity to fight these threats and keep users safer:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Antivirus</h3>
      <p>
        Installing antivirus software like Avast, Kaspersky, or Norton and keeping it updated helps detect and block viruses by scanning files for malicious code.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Ad Blockers</h3>
      <p>
        Use browser extensions like uBlock to reduce misleading pop-up ads. These tools also limit advertisers from collecting personal data.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Strong Passwords</h3>
      <p>
        Create strong and unique passwords for every account, using symbols and numbers. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra protection.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Regular Updates</h3>
      <p>
        Keep the operating system, browsers, and apps up to date to patch vulnerabilities. Enable auto-update when possible.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Secure Browsing</h3>
      <p>
        Prefer HTTPS over HTTP, especially when entering sensitive data. Avoid clicking untrusted or suspicious links.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Regularly back up data on the cloud and encrypt sensitive info against unauthorized access.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Awareness and Education</h3>
      <p>
        Teach children about cyberbullying and safe practices. Stay alert for phishing attempts, check emails/accounts for suspicious activity, and always remain skeptical of unsought messages.
      </p>
