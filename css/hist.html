      <h2>Origins of the Web</h2>
      <p>
        In 1989, a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web at CERN.
        Its purpose was to distribute scientific research easily between universities and institutes.
        His first proposal suggested a system called “Information Management: A Proposal”, but it lacked
        detailed specifications, so he submitted a second proposal called “Hypertext and CERN”, outlining
        the concepts of URLs, HTML, and a protocol for requesting and transferring documents. This laid
        the foundation for the modern web.

      <h2>Web Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        After the World Wide Web, the Line-mode browser — the second browser ever — was created. It was text-based and
        could run on various computers. Shortly after, Mosaic became the first graphical browser. It allowed users to view
        images and navigate hyperlinks. Its success inspired Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, leading to the
        browser wars. The competition accelerated innovation, leading to the creation of CSS, JavaScript, and more. HTML
        progressed through versions 2.0, 3.2, 4.01, XHTML, and HTML5, allowing web pages to work consistently across
        browsers.

        <h3>The Latest in HTML Development</h3>
        <p>
          HTML5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. However, it is constantly maintained and improved by the WHATWG
          and W3C. So while there is no official HTML6, HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands of modern web
          development.

        <h3>Intro of Arabic Letters and Symbols</h3>
        <p>
          In 2009, ICANN announced it would allow top-level domain names written in local languages and alphabets, not
          just Latin. In 2013, the first Arabic borderless TLD <strong>شبكة</strong> (which means "web" in Arabic) was
          launched.

      <h2>Modern Browsers</h2>
      <p>
        Today, web browsers such as <strong>Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari</strong> prioritize speed, security, and
        user experience. The rise of mobile-first browsers has shifted design priorities toward responsive layouts,
        ensuring websites function seamlessly across devices. According to StatCounter
        <sup><a href="references.html#r4">[4]</a></sup>    
, Chrome is the leading browser with 69.23% of users worldwide. Its closest
        competitor, Safari, holds 14.98%, followed by Microsoft Edge at 5.03%.

      <h2>The Future of the Web</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, the web is evolving with cloud-based applications, AI integration, and voice browsing, which expand
        how users interact with online content. The next major phase is Web 4.0, also called the Intelligent or Symbiotic
        Web. It is based on machine learning, AI, and decentralized technology. Some key features include artificial
        intelligence, the Internet of Things, decentralization, advanced interactivity, and user-centric design. It is
        expected to impact industries such as healthcare, smart city management, agriculture, education, and
        transportation. <sup><a href="references.html#r5">[5]</a></sup>
