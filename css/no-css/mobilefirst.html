    <h2>What is Mobile-First Development?</h2>
    <P>Mobile-First design is a type of development that follows the concept of progressive enhancement. It prioritizes smaller screens, before enhancing the features for larger ones like desktops.

    <h2>Mobile-First Principles</h2>
    <P>Mobile-first is a design approach aimed at enhancing the user experience. Its not just creating layouts for smaller screens but has principles to ensure the strategy is applied effectively and consistently across all devices. Here are some core principles of mobile-first design:</P>

    <ul>
        <li>Use white space wisely and limit navigation to the most important elements to keep layouts simple.</li>
        <li>Create a clear visual hierarchy using headings, paragraphs and text styles so that viewers can identify what content is most important first.</li>
        <li>Optimize text for scanning as users scan rather than read and look for patterns such as from left to right or top to bottom.</li>
        <li>Avoid hover effects as they are insignificant on mobile. Use touch or slide gestures familiar to users and make sure tap targets are wide enough for fat fingers (at least 30-44px).</li>
        <li>Add alt-text for SEO and optimize photos and media for mobile devices, saving complex visuals for desktop.</li>
    </ul>
